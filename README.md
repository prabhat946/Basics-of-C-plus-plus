# Hello World and Simple Calculator

## Experiment 1

### AIM
To print "Hello World" and program a simple calculator in C++.

### Theory
C++ is a general-purpose, high-performance programming language that builds on the foundation of the C language. Developed by Bjarne Stroustrup in the early 1980s at Bell Labs, C++ is a cross-platform language used to create high-performance applications. It supports object-oriented programming, making it a versatile tool for various types of software development.

This experiment consists of two practicals:
1. Printing "Hello World"
2. Creating a calculator program

### Experiment 1 (Part 1): Hello, World!

In the Hello World program, the `cout` function from the `iostream` library is commonly used to print output to the console. The `iostream` library in C++ is a part of the Standard Library and provides functionalities for input and output operations. The `using namespace std;` directive is used to avoid the need to prefix standard library names with `std::`.

### Experiment 1 (Part 2): Simple Calculator

Basic arithmetic operations (`+`, `-`, `*`, `/`) were used to create the calculator program. The `cin` function is used to receive inputs from the user.
